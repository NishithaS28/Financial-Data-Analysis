# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project uses Python to analyze and predict stock prices based on historical data. It focuses on:
- Analyzing 10 years of stock data using the `yfinance` library.
- Building a deep learning model (LSTM) to predict future stock prices.
- Visualizing the actual vs predicted stock prices.

## Features
1. **Data Analysis**: Includes moving averages for better trend analysis.
2. **Deep Learning Prediction**: Predicts stock prices using LSTM.
3. **Visualizations**: Plots closing prices, moving averages, and prediction trends.
